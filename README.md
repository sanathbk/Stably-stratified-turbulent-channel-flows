# Mean velocity profile in stably stratified channel turbulence


The repository contains the source code that reconstructs the mean velocity profile in stably stratified turbulent channels for given $Re_{\tau}$ and $Ri_{\tau}$.

The notebook can be modified and run in [Google's colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sanathbk/Stably-stratified-turbulent-channel-flows/blob/main/MOST_Ch.ipynb)
